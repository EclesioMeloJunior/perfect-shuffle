# perfect-shuffle

Provably perfect random shuffling and its pure function implementations

The article first formally defines the perfect random shuffle, outlines the algorithm, and discusses the well-know imperative shuffler that swaps elements in the array. We present and analyze two purely functional implementations. The naive one runs in O(n^2) time. A more sophisticated code has the O(n*logn) time complexity.
